# Step 1 

create an equation that solves for how many plants are grown in a given week with 2^x where x is week #
not exceeding 98 plants in total because that's how many can fit in the area given 
98=>plants grown per week

# Step 2 

create a calculator for the equation using if statments that 98 is the highest number achieved for plants grown per week 
plantsGrownPerWeek = 2^x * week#


# Step 3
implement control flow for pruned/monitored/planted
