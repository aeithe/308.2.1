# Step 1 

create an equation that solves for how many plants are grown in a given week with 2^x where x is week #
not exceeding 98 plants in total because that's how many can fit in the area given 
98=>plants grown per week

# Step 2 

create a calculator for the equation using if statments that 98 is the highest number achieved for plants grown per week 
plantsGrownPerWeek = 2^x * week#


# Step 3
implement control flow for pruned/monitored/planted

 The conservation area in which the garden is located has multiple other gardens. 
Using the logic you have already created, determine:
The amount of additional space that would be required if the scientists were to start with 100 plants, and did not prune them for 10 weeks.
If the space remained circular, what would be the radius of this expanded garden?
